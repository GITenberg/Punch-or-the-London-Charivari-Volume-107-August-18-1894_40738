<h2>MORE ORNAMENTAL THAN USEFUL.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Legend of the Results of the School Board.</i>)</p>

<p>The Committee sat waiting patiently for candidates. Although the papers
had been full of advertisements describing the appointments the
<i>réclames</i> had had no effect. There were certainly a number of persons
in the waiting-room, but the usher had declared that they did not
possess the elementary qualifications for the post that the Committee
were seeking to fill with a suitable official.</p>

<p>"Usher," cried the Chairman at length with some impatience; "I am sure
you must be wrong. Let us see some of the occupants of the adjoining
office."</p>

<p>The usher bowed with a grace that had been acquired by several years
study in deportment in the Board School, and replied that he fancied
that most of the applicants were too highly educated for the coveted
position.</p>

<p>"Too highly educated!" exclaimed the representative of municipal
progress. "It is impossible to be too highly educated! You don't know
what you're talking about!"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Sir," returned the Usher, with another graceful inclination
of the head, "but would not 'imperfectly acquainted with the subject of
your discourse' be more polished? But, with your permission, I will obey
you."</p>

<p>And then the official returned
to usher in an aged man wearing spectacles. The veteran
immediately fell upon his knees and began to implore the Committee
to appoint him to the vacant post.</p>

<p>"I can assure you, Gentlemen, that, thanks to the School Board,
I am a first-rate Latin and Greek scholar. I am intimately
acquainted with the Hebrew language, and have the greatest possible
respect for the Union Jack. I know all that can be known
about mathematics, and can play several musical instruments. I am
also an accomplished waltzer; I know the use of the globes, and
can play the overture to <i>Zampa</i> on the musical-glasses. I know the
works of <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> backwards, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, stop!" interrupted the Chairman. "You may do all this,
and more; but have you any knowledge of the <i>modus operandi</i> of
the labour required of you?"</p>

<p>"Alas, no!" returned the applicant; "but if a man of education&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Remove him, Usher!" cried the Chairman; and the veteran
was removed in tears.</p>

<p>A second, a third, and a fourth made their appearance, and disappeared,
and none of them would do. They were all singularly
accomplished.</p>

<p>At length a rough man, who had been lounging down the street,
walked into the Council-chamber.</p>

<p>"What may you want, Sir?" asked the Chairman, indignantly.</p>

<p>"What's that to you?" was the prompt reply. "I ain't a going to
tell everyone my business&mdash;not me&mdash;you bet!"</p>

<p>"Ungrammatical!" said Committee Man No. One. "Very promising."</p>

<p>"Uncouth and vulgar!" murmured Committee Man No. Two.</p>

<p>"Where were you educated?" queried the Chairman.</p>

<p>"Nowheres in particular. I was brought up in the wilds of
Canada. There's not much book learning over there," and the rough
fellow indulged in a loud hoarse laugh.</p>

<p>"Ah! that accounts for your not having enjoyed the great advantages
of the School Board. Have you seen the circular&mdash;have you
read the details of the proposed appointment?"</p>

<p>"Me read!" cried the uncouth one; "oh, that is a game!
Why I can't read nor yet
write!"</p>

<p>"Better and better," said Committee Man No. One.</p>

<p>"First rate," murmured Committee Man No. Two. "I think we have at length
found our ideal."</p>

<p>Then the usher read the advertisement.</p>

<p>"What! shake the hall mat!" cried the candidate. "Why I could do that
little job on my head!"</p>

<p>So there being no other applicant for the post, the backwoods' ignoramus
was appointed office-sweeper at a couple of hundred pounds a year.</p>

<p>"Rather high wages," said the Chairman to himself, as he went home on
the top of an omnibus; "but what can one expect when we educate all the
children at the cost of the rates. Last year there was an additional
farthing; this year we have to pay five shillings, and goodness only
knows how much it will be hereafter!"</p>

<p>And as he thought this, the Chairman (in the names of the rest of the
ratepayers) heartily cursed the School Board.</p>

<h2>RE-DRESS REQUIRED.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>[A writer in the <i>Lancet</i> draws attention to the fact that the regular
hospital nurse's uniform is now worn as ordinary ladies' attire.]</p></blockquote>

<p>There's no doubt my new costume is <i>very</i> becoming. I like the idea or
the cape, and the apron is just perfect, while the little bonnet suits
me to a T. Met cousin <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, who said it was "fetching," and that "they
wanted some of my sort at the hospitals." I said I thought the patients
had good enough nurses at present; he replied "he didn't mean the
patients&mdash;he meant the doctors." Of course I couldn't stand the
drudgery of a nurse's life; but that's no reason why I shouldn't
appropriate the uniform, is it?</p>

<p>Walking down street. Met another nurse&mdash;a real one, I suppose.
She stared, turned red, and then looked horribly offended. I believe
she must have made some sign to me that I didn't understand. Are
Nurses Freemasons, I wonder? Quite a secret society, it seems.
Really that sort of thing oughtn't to be allowed. It makes things
so awkward for the impost&mdash;the imitators, I mean.</p>

<p>Just got home after <i>dreadful</i> incident! I was in a Bayswater
Square, when suddenly a man driving round a corner in a cart got
upset, and was pitched on to the road close to me. A small crowd
gathered immediately, and evidently expected <i>me</i> to help. One man
shouted "Hi! Come and bind up his head, Miss!" And his head
was actually bleeding! I couldn't do anything, except feel awfully
inclined to faint, and then the mob began to hiss and jeer! Somebody
said I must know how to render "first aid to the injured,"
and if I didn't come quick the man would bleed to death. I was so
frightened I ran away, and the mob ran after me, and I had to take
shelter in a shop, and ask the shopman to explain to the crowd that
I was not really a nurse at all. Then they used dreadful expressions,
and I had to be got out by a back way. I don't think the costume is
half as becoming as it seemed this morning; I'm going to sell it as
a "cast-off garment." Lucky for me it wasn't a torn-off garment!</p>

<h2>HINT FOR THE ALPINE SEASON.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Adapted freely from the Old Royal Repartee.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><i>Middle-aged would-be Mountaineer (loq.).</i></p>

<p>
Fain would I climb, but,&mdash;well, my belt's too small.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><i>Mr. Punch (in reply).</i></span><br />
<br />
If your girth grows, Sir, <i>do not climb at all</i>!<br />
Your Alpen-stock put by, ere the world mock.<br />
And you become an (Alpine) Laughing-stock.<br />
Though Alps on Alps arise <i>you</i> stop in bed,<br />
And let a younger man yon glaciers tread.<br />
The dangers of steep slides and deep crevasses<br />
Are not for elderly donkeys, but young asses.<br />
The Himalayas woo you still to pant on?<br />
Well, treat 'em as you would an arch young wanton,<br />
Think of your legs, the boys, the girls, the Missus,<br />
And do not play the elderly Narcissus.<br />
To witch the world with noble "Icemanship"<br />
Is tempting, yes, but if you chance to slip,<br />
Your bones a fathomless abyss may strew,<br />
An Alpine death,&mdash;and they'll all pine for you.<br />
Man after fifty fits not the sublime,<br />
So stay at home nor seek a foreign climb.<br />
The plague of guide, and chum, and wife and daughter,<br />
Is Senex who will climb and didn't oughter.<br />
Stick to your Alpine Club, but like old foodles,<br />
Pay, stop at home, and play at whist at Boodles'.<br />
Decline with the old mania to be bitten,<br />
And you will own this tip is diamond-written<br />
(Like good Queen Bess's repartee on glass),<br />
And that you're saved from being an old ass!<br />

And <i>what</i> does this choleric youth<br />

It does seem unfitting, you know&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At least as we Westerners see things&mdash;</span><br />
That the lord of Souchong and Pekoe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should be guilty of smashing up tea-things!</span><br />
Of course, if he had an idea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of breaking the Japanese bondage,</span><br />
Or breaking their hold on Korea,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well, youth is a fiery and fond age,</span><br />
And old age <i>might</i> find an excuse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For breaking the peace; but kind wishes</span><br />
Can hardly invent an excuse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For breaking the plates and the dishes.</span><br />

<h2>"JUSTICE AS SHE IS SPOKEN IN FRANCE."</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;Now that we are close upon the silly season,
when it is most difficult to get interesting "copy" for the columns
of the daily papers, may I be permitted to make a suggestion? No
doubt you have seen an account of the examination of <span class="smcap">Caserio
Santo</span> by the President of the Court on the occasion of his trial.
Could not the idea be naturalised in London by the Metropolitan
Police Magistrates? I would not, of course, propose to apply
the method in cases of a serious character, but used in what are known
as "the night charges," the practice would become very interesting.
To better explain my meaning. I will imagine that a prisoner
who has been arrested on a charge of being "drunk and incapable" is
standing in front of his worship.</p>

<p><i>Magistrate</i> (<i>with sarcasm</i>). You are sober now.</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i> (<i>in the same tone</i>). As a judge.</p>

<p><i>Magistrate</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). Judges are always sober.</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i> (<i>with a laugh</i>). How should <i>you</i> know?&mdash;you, who are
only a magistrate!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Murmurs.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> You insult me! But that will not serve you. Drink
is the curse of the country!</p>

<p><i>Prisoner.</i> You have tried it? It has been a curse to you!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Cries of disapproval.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> You are young to bandy words with one old enough
to be your father!</p>

<p><i>Prisoner.</i> My father! You my father! What an honour!</p>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> I do not envy him! Nor your mother!</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i> (<i>excitedly</i>). You shall not speak of my mother. My
mother is sacred. She shall not be referred to in the tainted atmosphere
of a Court of Justice.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Applause.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> This hypocrisy shall not serve you. You never loved
your mother!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Prolonged sensation.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Prisoner.</i> Your worship, you are a liar!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Loud cheers.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> This to the Bench from the gutter! For you know
you were found drunk and incapable in the gutter. What were you
doing there?</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i> (<i>tearfully</i>). I was dreaming of my mother, my loved
mother.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Sympathetic applause.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> You do not deserve to have a mother!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Prolonged sensation.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Prisoner</i> (<i>scornfully</i>]. Only a magistrate could make such a cold-blooded
observation!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Cheers.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> For all that you are fined five shillings and costs!
Remove the wretched prisoner!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The accused was then removed amidst expressions of sympathy
from the body of the Court.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>There, Sir, would not that be far better reading than paragraphs
about gigantic gooseberries and leaders upon the sea serpent?
Perhaps my suggestion may be adopted in the proper quarter.
Hoping that this may be the case, the police case,</p>

journey and the long drive afterwards! I always tell <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> he
would see me <i>far</i> oftener at Wyvern if he would only get the Company
to bring the line round close to the Park Gates, but it has <i>no</i>
effect upon him! (<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span> <i>announces</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, <i>who enters
in trepidation.</i>) Mr. <span class="smcap">James Spurrell</span>! Who's Mr.&mdash;&mdash;? Oh, to
be sure; <i>that</i>'s the name of my interesting young poet&mdash;<i>Andromeda</i>,
you know, my dear! Go and be pleasant to him, <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>, he wants
reassuring.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin (a trifle nervous).</i> How do you do, Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>?
(<i>To herself.</i>) I <i>said</i> he
ended in "'ell"! (<i>Aloud.</i>) So pleased
to see you! We think so much of your
<i>Andromeda</i> here, you know. Quite
delightful of you to find time to run
down!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell (to himself).</i> Why <i>she</i>'s
chummy, too! Old Drummy pulls me
through everything! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Don't
name it, my la&mdash;hum&mdash;Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span>.
No trouble at all; only too
proud to get your summons!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv. (to herself).</i> He doesn't
seem very revolutionary! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
That's so sweet of you; when so many
must be absolutely fighting to get you!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Oh, as for that, there <i>is</i>
rather a run on me just now, but I put
everything else aside for <i>you</i>, of course!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv. (to herself).</i> He's soon
<i>reassured</i>. (<i>Aloud, with a touch of
frost.</i>) I am sure we must consider
ourselves most fortunate. (<i>Turning
to the</i> Countess.) You <i>did</i> say cream,
<span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>? Sugar, <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> dearest?</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> I'm all right
up to now! I suppose I'd better say
nothing about the horse till <i>they</i> do.
I feel rather out of it among these
nobs, though. I'll try and chum on
to little Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> again; she may
have got over her temper by this time,
and she's the only one I know. (<i>He
approaches her.</i>) Well, Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>,
here I <i>am</i>, you see. I'd really no idea
your aunt would be so friendly! I
say, you know, you don't mind <i>speaking</i>
to a fellow, do you? I've no one
else I can go to&mdash;and&mdash;and it's a bit
strange at first, you know!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie (coloured with mingled
apprehension, vexation, and pity).</i> If
I can be of any help to you, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Well, if you'd only tell me
what I ought to <i>do</i>!</p>

<h3>"My keys! Why, what do you want <i>them</i> for?"</h3>
</div>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Surely that's very simple; do <i>nothing</i>; just take
everything quietly as it comes, and you <i>can't</i> make any mistakes.</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (anxiously).</i> And you don't think anybody'll see anything
odd in my being here like this?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie (to herself).</i> I'm only too afraid they <i>will</i>! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
You really <i>must</i> have a little self-confidence. Just remember that
no one here could produce anything a millionth part as splendid as
your <i>Andromeda</i>! It's <i>too</i> distressing to see you so <i>appallingly</i>
humble! (<i>To herself.</i>) There's Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span> over there&mdash;he
<span class="smcap">might</span> come and rescue me; but he doesn't seem to care to!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Well, you <i>do</i> put some heart into me, Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>. I feel
equal to the lot of 'em now!</p>

<p><i>Pilliner</i> (<i>to</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane</span>). Is <i>that</i> the Poet? Why, but I say&mdash;he's
a <i>fraud</i>! Where's his matted head? He's not a bit ragged,
or rusty either. And why don't he dabble? Don't seem to know
what to do with his hands quite, though, <i>does</i> he?</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane (coldly).</i> He knows how to do some very exquisite
poetry with <i>one</i> of them, at all events. I've been reading it, and <i>I</i>
think it perfectly marvellous!</p>

<p><i>Pill.</i> I see what it is, you're preparing to turn his matted head
for him? I warn you you'll only waste your sweetness. That
pretty little Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie's</span> annexed <i>him</i>. Can't you content yourself
with <i>one</i> victim?</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> Don't be so utterly idiotic! (<i>To herself.</i>) If <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>
imagines she's to be allowed to monopolise the only man in the room
worth talking to!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself, as he watches</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>). She is
lookin' prettier than ever! Forgotten me. Used to be friendly enough
once, though, till her mother warned me off. Seems to have a good
deal to say to that Poet fellow; saw her colour up from here the
moment he came near; he's <i>begun</i> Petrarchin', hang him! I'd cross
over and speak to her if I could catch her eye. Don't know, though;
what's the use? She wouldn't thank me for interruptin'. She
likes these clever chaps; don't signify to her if they <i>are</i> bounders,
I suppose. <i>I</i>'m not intellectual. Gad, I wish I'd gone back to
Aldershot!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant. (by the tea-table).</i> Why don't you make that woman
of yours send you up decent cakes, my dear? These are cinders.
I'm afraid you let her have too much of her own way. Now, tell me&mdash;who
are your party? <span class="smcap">Vivien Spelwane!</span>
Never have that girl to meet
me again, I can't <i>endure</i> her; and
that affected little ape of a Mr. <span class="smcap">Pilliner</span>&mdash;h'm!
Do I see Captain
<span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>? Now, I don't object to
<i>him</i>. <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> and he used to be great
friends.... Ah, how do you <i>do</i>, Captain
<span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>? Quite pleasant
finding you here; such ages since we
saw anything of you! Why haven't
you been near us all this time?...
Oh, I may have been out once or twice
when you called; but you might have
tried again, <i>mightn't</i> you? There, <i>I</i> forgive
you; you had better go and see if
you can make your peace with <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>!</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick. (to himself, as he
obeys).</i> Doosid odd, the Countess comin'
round like this. Wish she'd thought
of it before.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant. (in a whisper).</i> He's
always been such a favourite of mine.
They tell me his uncle, poor dear Lord
<span class="smcap">Dunderhead</span>, is <i>so</i> ill&mdash;felt the loss
of his only son so terribly. Of course
it will make a great difference&mdash;in
many ways.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> (<i>constrainedly to</i> Lady
<span class="smcap">Maisie</span>). How do you do? Afraid
you've forgotten me.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Oh no, indeed! (<i>Hurriedly.</i>)
You&mdash;you don't know Mr.
<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, I think? (<i>Introducing
them.</i>) Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> How are you? Been
hearin' a lot about you lately. <i>Andromeda</i>,
don't you know; and that kind
of thing.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> It's wonderful what a hit she
seems to have made&mdash;not that I'm <i>surprised</i>
at it, either; I always knew&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie (hastily).</i> Oh, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, you haven't had any tea!
<i>Do</i> go and get some before it's taken
away.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> <i>goes</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Been tryin' to get you to notice me ever since you
came; but you were so awfully absorbed, you know!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Was I? So absorbed as all that! What with?</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Well, it looked like it&mdash;with talkin' to your poetical
friend.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie (flushing).</i> He is not <i>my</i> friend in particular; I&mdash;I
admire his poetry, of course.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick. (to himself).</i> Can't even speak of him without
a change of colour. Bad sign that! (<i>Aloud.</i>) You always <i>were</i>
keen about poetry and literature and that in the old days, weren't
you? Used to rag me for not readin' enough. But I do now. I was
readin' a book only last week. I'll tell you the name if you give me
a minute to think&mdash;book everybody's readin' just now&mdash;no end of a
clever book.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, dear, how are you? You look <i>so</i> tired!
That's the journey, I suppose. (<i>Whispering.</i>) Do tell me&mdash;is that
really the author of <i>Andromeda</i> drinking tea close by? You're a
<i>great</i> friend of his, I know. Do be a dear, and introduce him to me!
I declare the dogs have made friends with him already. Poets have
such a wonderful attraction for animals, haven't they?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw. (with shy adoration).</i> Oh, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, I feel as if
I <i>must</i> talk to you about <i>Andromeda</i>. I <i>did</i> so admire it!</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> Another of 'em! They seem uncommonly
sweet on "bulls" in this house! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Very glad to hear you
say so, I'm sure. I've seen nothing to touch her myself. I don't
know if you noticed all her points&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> Indeed, I believe none of them were lost upon me;
but my poor little praise must seem so worthless and ignorant!</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (indulgently).</i> Oh, I wouldn't say <i>that</i>. I find some ladies
very knowing about these things. I'm having a picture done
of her.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> Are you really? <i>How</i> delightful! As a frontispiece?</p>

<p><i>Spurr</i>. Eh? Oh no&mdash;full length, and sideways&mdash;so as to show her
legs, you know.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> Her legs? Oh, of <i>course</i>&mdash;with "her roseal toes
cramped." I thought that such a <i>wonderful</i> touch!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> They're not more cramped than they ought to be; she
never turned them <i>in</i>, you know!</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw. (mystified).</i> I didn't mean that. And now tell me&mdash;if
it's not an indiscreet question&mdash;when do you expect there'll be
another edition?</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> Another addition! <i>She</i>'s cadging for a pup
now! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Oh&mdash;er&mdash;really&mdash;couldn't say.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> I'm sure the first must be disposed of by this time.
I shall look out for the next <i>so</i> eagerly!</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> Time I "off"ed it. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Afraid I can't
say anything definite&mdash;and, excuse me leaving you, but I think
Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span> is looking my way.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> Oh, by all <i>means</i>! (<i>To herself.</i>) I might as well
praise a pillar-post! And after spending quite half an hour reading
him up, too! I wonder if <span class="smcap">Bertie Pilliner</span> was right; but I shall
have him all to myself at dinner.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> And where is <i>Rupert</i>? too busy of <i>course</i> to come
and say a word! Well, some day he may understand what a sister
is&mdash;when it's too late. Ah, here's our nice unassuming young poet
coming up to talk to you. Don't <i>repel</i> him, my dear!</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> Better give her the chance of telling me
what's wrong with the horse, I suppose. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Er&mdash;nice old-fashioned
sort of house this, Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span>. (<i>To himself.</i>) I'll
work round to the stabling presently.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv. (coldly).</i> I believe it dates from the Tudors&mdash;if that is
what you mean.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> My dear <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>, I <i>quite</i> understand him; "old-fashioned"
is <i>exactly</i> the epithet. And I was born and brought up
here, so perhaps I should know.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>A footman enters, and comes up to</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> <i>mysteriously.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Footman.</i> Will you let me have your keys, if you please, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (in some alarm).</i> My keys! (<i>Suspiciously.</i>) Why, what do
you want <i>them</i> for?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant. (in a whisper).</i> Isn't he <i>deliciously</i> unsophisticated?
Quite a child of nature! (<i>Aloud.</i>) My dear Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, he
wants your keys to unlock your portmanteau and put out your
things; you'll be able to dress for dinner all the quicker.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Do you mean&mdash;am I to have the honour of sitting down
with all of <i>you</i>?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv. (to herself).</i> Oh, my goodness, what <i>will</i> <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>
say? (<i>Aloud.</i>) Why, of course, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>; how can you ask?</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (feebly).</i> I&mdash;I didn't know, that was all. (<i>To</i> Footman).
Here you are, then. (<i>To himself.</i>) Put out my things? he'll find
nothing to put out except a nightgown, sponge bag, and a couple of
brushes! If I'd only known I should be let in for this, I'd have
brought dress-clothes. But how <i>could</i> I? I&mdash;I wonder if it would be
any good telling 'em quietly how it is. I shouldn't like 'em to think
I hadn't got any. (<i>He looks at</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Cantire</span> <i>and her sister-in-law,
who are talking in an undertone.</i>) No, perhaps I'd better let it
alone. I&mdash;I can allude to it in a joky sort of way when I come
down!</p>

<h2>"TO BE TAKEN AS READ."</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;Thanks to the action of the Circulating
Libraries, it seems that the old-fashioned three-volume novel is
doomed to become a work of the past. Most of the popular writers
have abandoned it, and now the publishers are beginning to fight
shy of it. The principal argument,
I believe, in favour of its retention
is that it gives a chance to "the
little read." The Circulating Libraries
are called upon to fill boxes
intended for the edification of subscribers
in the country, and in
these receptacles of light literature
I believe the unpopular authors
have their greatest chance. But
as a matter of fact, although a
romance may be sent to a peruser,
it is not within the scope of civilisation
to cause that romance to be
read. According to statistics I believe
about sixty per cent of the
second and third rate is only
sampled by the recipients of the
aforesaid boxes. The last couple
of pages of the third volume are
largely read, whilst the remainder
of the work is saved from the
labours of the paper-knife. As this is so, would it not be as well to
give a "common form" <i>finale</i> to serve as a model for novels <i>in
extremis</i>? To make my meaning plainer I will give an example.</p>

</div>

<p>Let me suppose that the country subscriber has received a novel per
parcels post called <i>The Deed in Drab</i>. Instead of having to cut some
nine hundred pages, he finds gummed to the inside of the cover what
I may call</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Last Chapter.</span></p>

<p>And so amidst the joy bells of the old church and the songs of the
nightingales, and the pleasant laughter of the little children, <span class="smcap">Edwin</span>
and <span class="smcap">Angelina</span> were married. As they passed under the oaken porch
the Duke gave them his blessing. Need it be said they lived happily&mdash;like
a prince and a princess in fairy tale&mdash;for ever after?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Montmorency Guilt</span>, kicked out of his club and warned off
the Turf at Newmarket, left England with his ill-gotten gains for
Cairo. Arrived in Egypt, he disappeared into the Soudan. Those
of the Arabs who came from the desert declare that there is a white
ruler in Khartoum. Whether it be he, who knows? Still, the stories
of cruelty brought back by the swarthy traders are not unsuggestive
of the man who brought poor <span class="smcap">Pauline</span> to her grave and broke the
Bank at Monte Carlo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward Watts</span> <i>did</i> marry <span class="smcap">Mary Beetles</span>, and they are now doing
well at Little Pannington. The village all-sorts shop has grown into a
"Stores," and those who are in the know say that at a near date it
will be converted into a "Company, Limited." Be this as it may,
<span class="smcap">Edward</span> and <span class="smcap">Mary</span> drive to chapel in their own gig.</p>

<p>And what became of <span class="smcap">Paul Peterson</span>? Overwhelmed with the
secret sorrow that could never be shared by another, he went his
way to the wilds of Australia. And there, under the starlight
influence of the Southern Cross, and amidst the glorious glaciers of
the Boomerang Mountains, he tries to forget the terrible and half-forgiven
details of the "Deed in Drab."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The End.</span></p>

<p>There, Sir, you have the ending of ninety-nine novels out of
a possible hundred. In the hands of an experienced writer the
sentences might be so adapted as to meet the requirements of the
book completing the century. Surely the suggestion is worthy of
the attention of a <span class="smcap">Mudie</span>, and the consideration of a <span class="smcap">W. H. Smith</span>.</p>

<h2>THE MESSAGE FROM MARS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Per favour of Mr. Punch.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> So you've not been signalling to Mother Earth, after
all, my noble Warrior?</p>

<p><i>Mars (with a wink).</i> What do <i>you</i> think? Why should I dig
canals 100 miles wide, and 2,000 miles long, or build bonfires as big
as Scotland, when I can always communicate what I may have to say
through you?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Because Mars looks spotty or misty,<br />
Some dreamers, with intellects twisty,<br />
<span class="i4">Imagine, old horse,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Mars is playing at Morse!</span><br />
All bosh! You ask <span class="smcap">Dyson</span> or <span class="smcap">Christie</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Maunder</span> "has you under his special charge,"
hasn't he?</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Much obliged to Mr. <span class="smcap">Maunder</span>, I'm sure! Wants to take
my photo, doesn't he? As if I were a mere politician, a popular
comedian, or <span class="smcap">'Arriet</span> at the seaside on a Bank Holiday!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Have you any Bank Holidays in your planet?</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Thank Sol, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, we have outlived the epoch of
taking our pleasure in spasms, like your cockney victims of the
vulgar voluptuary's St. Vitus's dance!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Don't be uppish, old man! 'Tis an ill-bred age of
Kodaks, and Interviews, and other phases of popular Paul Pryism.
But you've had your ignominious moments, Mars. If a "snap-shot"
could have been taken at you when held prostrate, chained,
and captive, at the feet of Otus and Ephialtes, or, still worse, when
caught with Venus in the iron net of Vulcan:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
All heaven beholds, imprison'd as they lie,<br />
And unextinguish'd laughter shakes the sky.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Spare me, excellent <i>Punch</i>. Eugh! Thank heaven
Olympus knew no Kodaks then, or "the gay Apollo" would yet
longer have had the laugh of me.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Pardon me for awaking unpleasant memories! But
even gods should not be bumptious, especially when, like the <i>Second
Mrs. Tanqueray</i>, they "have a past."</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Well, anyhow I've been able to baffle the camera-wielders
up to now. My ruddy countenance and "bluish radiance" have
beaten Greenwich, and even licked the Lick! As they themselves
admit, "Mars up to the present has defied cameral detection."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> But what about those "bright spots"?</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Have you no "bright spots" even on your dull and foggy
old planet? I have often noticed one at 85, Fleet Street. In June
and December it emits thousands of brilliant sparks of a "bluish
radiance," too. But I don't jump to the conclusion that you are
"signalling" to me. Look, the naked eye can see the Punchian
"<i>projection lumineuse</i>" even from here!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> I do not have to "signal" my messages to "Hellas"
or "<span class="smcap">Lockyer's</span> Land" by canals or "ten million arc lights of
100,000 candle-power apiece." Like the Sun, I am self-luminous,
and do not, like the finest planets, shine by reflected light.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> True for you. And from your own intellectual observatory,
like <span class="smcap">Teufelsdroeckh</span> "alone with the stars," you ofttimes scan the
heavens when, as <span class="smcap">Longfellow</span> says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"&mdash;&mdash;the first watch of night is given<br />
<span class="i2">To the red planet Mars."</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Precisely!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Murmurs musingly.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>
And earnest thoughts within me rise<br />
<span class="i4">When I behold afar,</span><br />
Suspended in the evening skies<br />
<span class="i4">The shield of that red star.</span></p>

<p>A star of strength! I see thee stand<br />
<span class="i4">And smile upon my pain;</span><br />
Thou beckonest with thy mailéd hand,<br />
<span class="i4">And I am strong again.</span></p>

<p>The star of the unconquered will<br />
<span class="i4">He rises in my breast.</span><br />
Serene, and resolute and still,<br />
<span class="i4">And calm, and self-possessed.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Ah yes! that's all very pretty and poetical, and I'm much
obliged to <span class="smcap">Henry Wadsworth</span> and the other bards who have lyrically
glorified me. But <i>Punch</i>, old man, <i>you and I know better</i>!
Mother Earth has ever paid, and payeth still, far too much worship
to Mars&mdash;the Mars of her own militant fancy. To tell you the truth,
<i>Punch</i>, I'm sick of my old <i>métier</i>, especially since Science stepped in
and bedevilled it past bearing with her big guns, and dynamite-bombs,
and treacherous torpedoes; weapons more fit for grubby
Vulcan's subterranean Cyclops than a god, a gentleman and a soldier
like me.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Hoho! That's the way the (<span class="smcap">Lockyer's</span>) land lies, eh?</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Exactly, <i>I</i> wasn't signalling to your stupid, conservative,
bellicose old world, which, like the Bourbons, learns nothing and
forgets nothing. Could I write in plain Titanic capitals across a
thousand square miles of my smoothest surface Mars's Straight Tip
to Mother Earth, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
FIGHTING'S AN EXPENSIVE BORE,<br />
SO DISARM AND WAR NO MORE!
</p></blockquote>

<p>what effect would it have on any of you, from civilised England,
with you to enlighten it, to the furious fighting dragons who are
tearing each other in the eastern seas? None! But if any of your
quidnuncs really want to know what I <i>would</i> say if I <i>did</i> signal,
tell them old Mars, grown wiser, has turned up War; has nailed
his raven to a barn-door as a warning; has made a pet of Peace's
soft-plumed dove; and strongly advises the belligerent boobies on
earth who take his old name in vain, and play his abandoned game
still, to&mdash;<i>go and do likewise</i>!!!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> By the cestus of Venus, and so I will!!!

<h2>ODE TO IXION.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By a Sympathetic, but Superficial Observer.</i>)</p>

<p>
Oh! the hardest of hearts some compassion must feel<br />
For that modern Ixion, the Man on the Wheel!<br />
See him scouring the roads on his spindly-spoked spider,<br />
Dust-hid till you scarce tell the "bike" from its rider;<br />
His abdomen shrunken, his shoulders up-humped,<br />
With the gaping parched lips of one awfully pumped.<br />
<i>Could</i> a camel condemned to the treadmill look worse?<br />
Sure those lips, could he close them, would shape to a curse<br />
On his horrible doom! As I gaze and stand by,<br />
With a pang at my heart, and a tear in my eye,<br />
I think of Ixion, the Wandering Jew,<br />
That Cork-leggèd Dutchman&mdash;the Flying One, too,<br />
And other poor victims of pitiless speed;<br />
And I own, while <i>their</i> cases were frightful indeed,<br />
The Bicyclist's fate is the worser by far.<br />
Poor soul!!! The small "pub," and a "pull" at the "bar,"<br />
Appear your best comfort. Imagine the cheer<br />
Of a slave of the "bike" whose sole solace is beer!<br />
You can't see the prospect; your eyes are cast down<br />
Like <span class="smcap">Bunyan's</span> <i>Muck-raker</i>; your brows in a frown<br />
Of purposeless effort are woefully knit;<br />
Of Nature's best charms you perceive not a bit.<br />
The hedge your horizon, the long, dusty road<br />
Is your sole point of sight. Wretched victim, what goad<br />
Of Fate, or sheer folly, thus urges you on?<br />
Old torments&mdash;like poor Io's gadfly&mdash;are gone,<br />
And yet, like Orestes, the Fury-whipped, you<br />
Wheel on, as some comet wheels on through the blue<br />
In billion-leagued cycles less dreary than is<br />
The cycle on which round the wide world you whiz!<br />
Eh? <i>Cutting a record?</i> You <i>like</i> it? The goose!!!<br />
A task without pleasure, a toil without use!<br />
Poor soul! You are worse than Ixion, I feel,<br />
For <i>he</i> was not tied <i>by himself</i> to the wheel!<br />

spending a week's holiday in the Mountains of the Moon, there a
recipe for removing the spots from the

to give an inventory of all the marvels.
Enough to say their name was legion.</p>

aërial contrivances to all the countries of the earth? What is there to
prevent you from starting flying-machines from London to Paris, or
Berlin, or even Timbuctoo?" Again there was a pleasant smile.
Evidently my guess was a good one.</p>

<p>"You will be able to travel thousands of miles without the assistance
of rails? You will dispense with land and water? All you will
require will be the atmosphere, and that is always with us&mdash;always
at our service."</p>

<p>Again my suggestions remained uncontradicted.</p>

<p>"It is truly marvellous," I remarked; "truly marvellous! And
you have commenced? You have been able to float through the air
for a dozen, a hundred feet?" There was a smile once again.</p>

<p>"And yet, perhaps, as railways and steamships are still 'firm' on
the Stock Exchange, it may be just as well to allow our holdings in
those securities to remain undisturbed? What do you think? It
is scarcely time to speculate for a fall?" Once more he smiled, and
as smiling is infectious, I joined him in his merriment.</p>

<h2>TO A VETERAN CHAMPION.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>[At Clifton, on Aug. 9, in Gloucestershire <i>v.</i> Middlesex, Dr. <span class="smcap">W. G. Grace</span> completed
his 1000 runs in first-class matches this summer. The other players
who share this distinction are <span class="smcap">Abel</span>, <span class="smcap">Albert Ward</span>, and <span class="smcap">Brockwell</span>.]</p></blockquote>

<p>
Well hit! <i>Mr. Punch</i> chalks it up once more&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your ten-hundredth run between the "creases"!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why, this (at twenty-two yards apiece) is</span><br />
Twelve-miles-and-a half for this season's score!<br />
<br />
But stay! we've no business to "notch" each mile!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With your cuts and draws, and your drives and trick hits,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You've only to stand still before the wickets,</span><br />
And straight to the boundary "fours" compile!<br />
<br />
With <span class="smcap">Abel</span>, <span class="smcap">Ward</span>, <span class="smcap">Brockwell</span>, you hold your own,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As '94 cricket now nears its finish;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We'll hope your four figures will ne'er diminish&mdash;</span><br />

<p>QUEER QUERIES.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Law and the Lady.</span>&mdash;Can it really
be true that at a place called Onehunga, in New Zealand, they have
a lady as Mayor? Surely this is altogether "<i>ultra vires</i>," as well
as being ultra-virile! My legal knowledge&mdash;which is considerable&mdash;convinces
me that there is a fatal flaw in the so-called election of a
woman to the chief post in a municipality, even in New Sheland&mdash;I
mean New Zealand. It's quite settled law that a <i>femme sole</i> cannot
be a Corporation; then how, I should like to know, can she preside
over a Corporation? Possibly some legal readers will say if their
opinion coincides with mine.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="center">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Lords, Monday Night, August 6.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Markiss</span> expected to
continue to-night that speech around the Budget he didn't commence
on second reading of the Bill. Sat mysteriously quiet on that
occasion. Unexpectedly broke out at following sitting, wanting to
know what <span class="smcap">Herschell</span> meant by saying Judicial Committee of Privy
Council had arrived at conclusion that Lords had no power to amend
a money bill. "Where's your report?" he asked. "Produce it."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">

</a>
<blockquote>
<p>The Macgregor proposes to "toss the Caber"&mdash;next
Session!</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Chancellor</span> didn't happen to have it in his waistcoat pocket
or secreted in wig. <span class="smcap">Markiss</span> gave notice that he would to-night
formally move for production of report. Flutter of interest in House.
Commons flocked in prepared for some fresh "blazing indiscretion."
Found the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span> sitting on woolsack chatting with <span class="smcap">Lord
Chancellor</span>. Held book between them, as
young persons about to marry are wont to do
when attending morning or evening service.
Vague idea that presently they would rise and
sing a hymn. <span class="smcap">Lord Chancellor</span> quite equal
to it, being a big gun at the Bar Musical Society
and very fond of the Opera. Nothing
however came of it, at least, not in that direction.
When hour for public business arrived
<span class="smcap">Markiss</span> left woolsack carrying the tune book
with him. His motion for report of Judicial
Committee stood half way down Orders of the
Day. When it was reached <span class="smcap">Markiss</span> said
nothing. Naturally other peers were silent,
and whilst commoners accustomed to other
ways of transacting business were marvelling
as to what had happened, and what would
follow, House adjourned, practically for a
week.</p>

<p>"Well," said <span class="smcap">Sark</span> for once nonplussed;
"certainly if there is a place in the world
where 'e don't know where 'e are, it's the
House of Lords. When a peer is expected to
speak he sits dumb. When arrangements have
been made for a quiet sitting, the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span> or
some other big gun is sure to go off unexpectedly
with alarming consequences."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Irish Evicted Tenants Bill
passed Report Stage in Commons.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;It is the unexpected that happens
in the House of Commons. Befel to-night with
dramatic suddenness. Third reading of Evicted
Tenants Bill moved. At eleven o'clock <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>
resumed his seat with pleased consciousness of
having cast some balm, in the shape of vitriol,
over Irish Question. House crowded; <span class="smcap">Devonshire</span>,
in depression and dinner dress, looked
down from Peers' Gallery. Over the clock sat
<span class="smcap">Sandhurst</span>, presently to move first reading of
Bill in House of Lords. Arranged Bill should
finally leave Commons to-night. Only one
hour in which <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span> might speak,
and <span class="smcap">John Morley</span> reply. <span class="smcap">Joseph</span> having despatched
his final arrow at his old friends the
Irish Members, the shaft being barbed with
points composing pleasing legend, "Violence,
Agitation, Dishonesty," <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span> rose,
with evident intent of showing, as has happened
several times this Session, how the same
sort of thing may be said with better effect in
quite another way.</p>

<p>Simultaneously from below gangway uprose the tall figure of <span class="smcap">John
Dillon</span>. Opposition roared with despairing indignation. Everything
settled, to last button on the gaiter; <span class="smcap">Joseph</span> had had his half-hour;
Prince <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> would take his, honourably leaving <span class="smcap">John
Morley</span> his thirty minutes. Then Division called; Bill read third
time; sent on to Lords; Commons comfortably home by half-past
twelve. And here was <span class="smcap">John Dillon</span> claiming the right to reply to
attacks and inuendos of the genial <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>!</p>

<p>Tumult rose; <span class="smcap">Dillon</span> folded his arms and faced it. A bad sign
that gesture. Remember it in years gone by, when all things were
topsy-turvey; when <span class="smcap">Forster</span> was Chief Secretary, and, next to
<span class="smcap">Parnell</span>, the hope of the Irish Members fighting for Home Rule
was <span class="smcap">Joseph Chamberlain</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dillon</span> in that attitude evidently immoveable; various suggestions
offered. Evade the Twelve o'Clock Rule, and sit till all was over;
adjourn the Debate. Finally agreed that Debate should be adjourned
till to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow, the day on which, at end of last real
fight of Session, most Members were off on the delayed holiday.</p>

<p>Out of this dilemma <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span> delivered a grateful House.
Had prepared his speech through long sitting; doubtless had many
bright things to say; but what was one speech among so many?
Perish his speech, rather than the whole arrangements of Parliamentary
week be upset. So gracefully stood aside; <span class="smcap">Dillon</span> took his
half hour; <span class="smcap">John Morley</span> followed in vigorous fighting form,
marking fresh step in steady improvement as Parliamentary debater;
and before midnight all was over.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Evicted Tenants Bill read third time by 199
votes against 167.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;M. de Londres&mdash;the Hangman, as blunt Britons put
it&mdash;called to-day. House engaged on Committee of Equalisation
of Rates Bill; seat found for Monsieur under Gallery, where private
secretaries of ministers and heads of public offices sit when Bills
affecting their departments are under discussion.</p>

<p>"Monsieur has something to do with the Home Office, <i>n'est ce
pas?</i>" I asked <span class="smcap">Sark</span>. "Looked in, I suppose, to help <span class="smcap">Asquith</span>?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Member for <span class="smcap">Sark</span>. "It's
not that. He's heard House intends to suspend
the Standing Orders. Wants to see how
<i>we</i> go to work. Not above taking a wrinkle
even from amateurs."</p>

<p>"Ah," said <span class="smcap">W. P. Jackson</span>, throwing up his
hands with gesture of despair. "Knew it
would come to this under present Government.
First the guillotine, then the gallows."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Quite a lot.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Southerners long heard of pleasurable
hours spent in Committee-room upstairs,
where Scotch Members been engaged
for weeks in Grand Committee on their Local
Government Bill. Such badinage! such persiflage!
not omitting refreshing influences of
another kind familiar in <i>Noctes Ambrosianæ</i>.
'Tis said, when conversation flagged quite usual
thing for <span class="smcap">J. B. Balfour</span> and <span class="smcap">Charles Pearson</span>
to strip off coats and waistcoats, place two
umbrellas crosswise on floor, and go through
sword-dance, <span class="smcap">Trevelyan</span> in the chair leading
off colourable imitation of bagpipe accompaniment,
in which Committee joined in mad chorus.</p>

<p>Not sure about that. Absolutely no doubt
that on last day of meeting all the members
stood on chairs, with one foot on the table, and,
holding hands, sang "<i>Auld Lang Syne</i>."
Bound to say they seem to have exhausted all
their hilarity in Committee-room. <span class="smcap">Parker
Smith</span> still a good deal to say; <span class="smcap">Hozier</span> not
uncommunicative; and <span class="smcap">Walter M'Laren</span>
enjoys keen satisfaction of insisting on Division
that presents smallest minority of the series.
But, on the whole, House seems filled with what
<span class="smcap">Sark</span> tell me Edinburgh, occasionally suffering
from the visitation, calls "an easterly haar."</p>

<p>Through the cold, wet, white fog, comes one
gleam of light. <span class="smcap">John Morley</span> brings in a Bill
making further provision with respect to Irish
Congested Districts Board. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> puts customary
question, "Who is prepared to bring in
this Bill?" "Mr. <span class="smcap">Arthur Balfour</span> and
myself," responds the <span class="smcap">Chief Secretary</span>; and
the House gratefully goes off into a fit of
laughter.</p>

<p>"Lovely in life," exclaims <span class="smcap">David Plunket</span>,
looking with almost equal affection on his two
right hon. friends, "on the Congested Districts
Board (Ireland) Bill they are not divided."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Scotch Local Government Bill.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Another "Nicht wi' <span class="smcap">Burns</span>." Sadder even than the last.
But sooner over. By eleven o'clock report stage agreed to. "Shall
we take third reading now, or would you like a third night with the
Bill?" asked <span class="smcap">Trevelyan</span>.</p>

<p>A shudder ran through the House; when it was over Bill hurried
past final stage.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Winding-up rapidly.</p>

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
